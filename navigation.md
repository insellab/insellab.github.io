For each type of data, we provide downloadable data in excel files, containing plots, analyzed data, un-analyzed counts etc. These serve as supporting materials for our paper on GPCRs in cancer.

For specific downloadable data, use either the menu on the left, or the links below. 

Please note that in all of these files, we use the same gene names as in the ‘source’ data, i.e. Hg19 gene names for mutations analysis, similar gene names for CNV corresponding to Affy SNP 6.0 arrays and GRC38 gene names for gene expression. GRC38 gene names used in expression analysis correspond to those currently used by IUPHAR. A table providing GPCR gene aliases used in each data set is provided in supplement 2 and also [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByccgsfmD86PbFd5R29paUQ4LUE). 

[Supplement 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROW2FWvDYlP7w5n-qMR8KMapnjkD2Ta9) 

Data supplement from our paper, containing totals for numbers of tumors with GPCR mutations, number of GPCR mutation events, frequency of GPCR CNV and also annotation of which genes we included in this analysis as ‘GPCRs’, along with appropriate synonyms.

[Supplement 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fdps90G7j2A3vb24L3ikICADZ-7fIjiC) 

Data supplement from our paper containing median gene expression in TPM and CPM for each tumor and normal tissue type.

[General Information](https://insellab.github.io/data) 

Tabulation of which tumor types we have studied, with number of replicates. Also links to our paper’s methods section. Provides some general comments about our approach for doing this analysis.

[GPCR mutations in tumors](https://insellab.github.io/gpcr_mutations) 

Status (whether mutated or not, indicated as a 1 or 0) for each GPCR in each TCGA sample, in each TCGA tumor type. Also provided are breakdowns of number and types of mutational events across these samples.

[GPCR CNV in tumors](https://insellab.github.io/gpcr_cnv) 

Copy Number Variation for each GPCR in each TCGA sample, in each TCGA tumor type.

[GPCR expression in solid tumors](https://insellab.github.io/gpcr_tcga_exp) 

GPCR expression in TPM and CPM units for each GPCR in each TCGA sample, in each TCGA tumor type. 

[GPCR expression in normal tissue](https://insellab.github.io/gpcr_gtex_exp) 

GPCR expression in TPM and CPM units for each GPCR in each GTEX sample, in each normal GTEX tissue type. 

[Differential Expression between tumors and normal tissue](https://insellab.github.io/gpcr_gtex_exp) 

GPCR expression in TPM and CPM units for each GPCR in each GTEX sample, in each normal GTEX tissue type.
