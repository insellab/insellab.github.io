## Additional Analyses


### GPCR coupling

The file below contains quantification of the number of GPCRs in each tissue type or tumor that couple to different classes of G-alpha G proteins. Also included are expression weighted quantifications of the same, plus the total number of GPCRs present at different expression thresholds.

### GPCR coupling worksheet

Use the link below to download a file into which you can paste a list of GPCRs and obtain quantifications of the number of those GPCRs that couple to each G-alpha G protein. Will also yield an expression-weighted version of this coupling calculation.

### Impact of GPCR expression on survival

Use the link below to download a file into which you can paste a list of GPCRs and obtain quantifications of the number of those GPCRs that couple to each G-alpha G protein. Will also calculate expression weighted versions of this

### Survival analysis with older patients excluded

For tumors with large number of replicates, the same analysis as above, but with exclusion of patients >75 years old at time of diagnosis as per TCGA metadata.

### Phylogenetic trees

From figure 4 of our updated manuscript, a phylogenetic fan plot showing different clusters of GPCRs in solid tumors, based on their median expression in TPM in each of 45 tumor types/subtypes.

From figure S2,  a phylogenetic fan plot showing different clusters of GPCRs in solid tumors, based on their fold change over corresponding normal tissue, in each of 45 tumor types/subtypes.
