### This page provides expression of GPCRs in cell lines provided by CCLE (Barretina et al, 2012) and Genentech (Klijn et al, 2015)

GPCR expression is quantified in FPKM, as downloaded from the [EBI Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home).

Data for [CCLE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2770/Results) is on sheet 10 and [Genentech](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2706/Results) dataset on sheet 11 in [Supplement 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROW2FWvDYlP7w5n-qMR8KMapnjkD2Ta9).


**GPCR expression in cell lines from these data sets in TPM are below:**
