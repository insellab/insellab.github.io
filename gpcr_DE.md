## Differential Expression of GPCRs in Tumors vs Normal tissue

For each type of tumor, the extent of DE for GPCRs, determined via EdgeR. Included are fold changes and statistical significance in terms of False Discovery Rate (FDR).

[DE of all GPCRs in each tumor type](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aJlgOi0Zn2mi783pGYjrm0lpIzpDfZ6F)

Provides fold changes and statistical significance of changes in mRNA expression of all GPCRs in solid tumors (from TCGA) vs. corresponding normal tissue (from GTEx database).

In addition, these data are also available in [Supplement 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROW2FWvDYlP7w5n-qMR8KMapnjkD2Ta9).

Changes in expression are considered meaningful if fold changes > 2 fold (increase or decrease), FDR < 0.05 and median expression in tumors > 1 TPM.
