## Differential Expression of GPCRs in Tumors vs Normal tissue

For each type of tumor, the extent of DE for GPCRs, determined via EdgeR. Included are fold changes and statistical significance in terms of False Discovery Rate (FDR).

These data are available in [Supplement 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROW2FWvDYlP7w5n-qMR8KMapnjkD2Ta9).

### Additional links will become active once our paper has completed peer review

[DE of all GPCRs in each tumor type]()

[Overexpressed GPCRs, including targets for approved drugs in each tumor type]()

[GPCRs that show reduced expression in each tumor type]()

Changes in expression are considered meaningful if fold changes > 2 fold (increase or decrease), FDR < 0.05 and median expression in tumors > 1 TPM.
