This work is a secondary analysis based on the efforts of multiple groups, including: the **UCSC Xena Project** ([https://xena.ucsc.edu](https://xena.ucsc.edu)), **The Cancer Genome Atlas** (TCGA, [https://cancergenome.nih.gov/](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/)), **The Genotype-Tissue Expression Database** (GTEX, [https://gtexportal.org/home/](https://gtexportal.org/home/)), and incorporating data on classification and characterization of GPCRs hosted by **IUPHAR** ([Link](http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ReceptorFamiliesForward?type=GPCR)).
